### The Spirit of the Project
This project was created for the purpose of learning and creating a modular system for Unity 2D that functions both as an Editor tool for designers and as a runtime system for dynamic character assembly. It is made open-source due to the use of LPC assets and to respect the **LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup)** spirit. It is shared to support the game development community and honor the philosophy of open collaboration.

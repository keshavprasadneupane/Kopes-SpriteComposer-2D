### The Spirit of the Project
This project was created for the purpose of learning and creating a modular system for Unity 2D that functions both as an Editor tool for designers and as a runtime system for dynamic character assembly. It is made open-source due to the use of LPC assets and to respect the **LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup)** spirit. It is shared to support the game development community and honor the philosophy of open collaboration.

## 4. Sprite Assets & LPC Compatibility
* **Asset Independence:** Designers are free to use **any sprite assets**—there is no requirement to use LPC assets. The system is modular and asset-agnostic.
* **Third-Party Rights:** Any LPC assets used within this system are **not** covered by this MIT license. 
* **LPC Licensing:** Users must comply with original LPC asset licenses (GNU GPL v3.0 / CC BY-SA 3.0). This license applies strictly to the C# source code logic.
